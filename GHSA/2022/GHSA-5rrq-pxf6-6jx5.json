	"details": "### Impact\nThe `forge.debug` API had a potential prototype pollution issue if called with untrusted input. The API was only used for internal debug purposes in a safe way and never documented or advertised.  It is suspected that uses of this API, if any exist, would likely not have used untrusted inputs in a vulnerable way.\n\n### Patches\nThe `forge.debug` API and related functions were removed in 1.0.0.\n\n### Workarounds\nDon't use the `forge.debug` API directly or indirectly with untrusted input.\n\n### References\n- https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/1-npm-node-forge/\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge).\n* Email us at support@digitalbazaar.com.",
