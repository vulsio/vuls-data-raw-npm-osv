	],
	"summary": "Next.js Vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling",
	"details": "### Impact\nInconsistent interpretation of a crafted HTTP request meant that requests are treated as both a single request, and two separate requests by Next.js, leading to desynchronized responses. This led to a response queue poisoning vulnerability in the affected Next.js versions.\n\nFor a request to be exploitable, the affected route also had to be making use of the [rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites) feature in Next.js.\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability is resolved in Next.js `13.5.1` and newer. This includes Next.js `14.x`.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no official workarounds for this vulnerability. We recommend that you upgrade to a safe version.\n\n### References\nhttps://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/advanced/response-queue-poisoning",
