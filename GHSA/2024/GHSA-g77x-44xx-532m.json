	"summary": "Denial of Service condition in Next.js image optimization",
	"details": "### Impact\nThe image optimization feature of Next.js contained a vulnerability which allowed for a potential Denial of Service (DoS) condition which could lead to excessive CPU consumption.\n\n**Not affected:**\n- The `next.config.js` file is configured with `images.unoptimized` set to `true` or `images.loader` set to a non-default value.\n- The Next.js application is hosted on Vercel. \n\n### Patches\nThis issue was fully patched in Next.js `14.2.7`. We recommend that users upgrade to at least this version.\n\n### Workarounds\nEnsure that the `next.config.js` file has either `images.unoptimized`, `images.loader` or `images.loaderFile` assigned.\n\n#### Credits\nBrandon Dahler (brandondahler), AWS\nDimitrios Vlastaras",
