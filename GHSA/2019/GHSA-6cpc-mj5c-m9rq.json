	"summary": "Arbitrary File Write in cli",
	"details": "Affected versions of `cli` use predictable temporary file names. If an attacker can create a symbolic link at the location of one of these temporarly file names, the attacker can arbitrarily write to any file that the user which owns the `cli` process has permission to write to.\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nBy creating Symbolic Links at the following locations, the target of the link can be written to.\n```\nlock_file = '/tmp/' + cli.app + '.pid',\nlog_file = '/tmp/' + cli.app + '.log';\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 1.0.0 or later.",
