	"summary": "Timing Attack in csrf-lite",
	"details": "Affected versions of `csrf-lite` are vulnerable to timing attacks as a result of testing CSRF tokens via a fail-early comparison instead of a constant-time comparison. \n\nTiming attacks remove the exponential increase in entropy gained from increased secret length, by providing per-character feedback on the correctness of a guess via miniscule timing differences.\n\nUnder favorable network conditions, an attacker can exploit this to guess the secret in no more than (16*18)288 guesses, instead of the 16^18 guesses required were the timing attack not present. \n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 0.1.2 or later.",
