	"details": "Versions of `express-basic-auth` prior to 1.1.7 are vulnerable to Timing Attacks. The package uses native string comparison instead of a constant time string comparison, which may lead to Timing Attacks. Timing Attacks can be used to increase the efficiency of brute-force attacks by removing the exponential increase in entropy gained from longer secrets.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 1.1.7 or later.",
