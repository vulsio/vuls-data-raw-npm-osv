	"summary": "Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) in @nextcloud/dialogs",
	"details": "### Impact\n\nThe Nextcloud dialogs library before 3.1.2 did insufficiently escape text input passed to a toast. If your application displays toasts with user-supplied input, this could lead to a XSS vulnerability.\n\n_Note_: Nextcloud Server employs a strict Content Security Policy that mitigates the risk of these XSS vulnerabilities.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in version 3.1.2. If you need to display HTML in the toast, explicitly pass the `options.isHTML` config flag.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nMake sure no user-supplied input flows into toasts.",
