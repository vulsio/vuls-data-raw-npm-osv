	"summary": "Denial of Service in uws",
	"details": "Affected versions of `uws` do not properly handle large websocket messages when `permessage-deflate` is enabled, which may result in a denial of service condition.\n\nIf `uws` recieves a 256Mb websocket message when `permessage-deflate` is enabled, the server will compress the message prior to executing the length check, and subsequently extract the message prior to processing. This can result in a situation where an excessively large websocket message passes the length checks, yet still gets cast from a Buffer to a string, which will exceed v8's maximum string size and crash the process.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 0.10.9 or later.\n\nAlternatively, disable `permessage-deflate`.",
