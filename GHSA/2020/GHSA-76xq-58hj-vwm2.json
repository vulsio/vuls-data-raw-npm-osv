	"details": "All versions of `test-module-a` contain malicious code as a preinstall script. The package fetches all names of npm packages owned by the user and attempts to add another maintainer to every package as a means of package hijacking,\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nRemove the package from your system. If you own any packages that were compromised please contact npm security immediately at security@npmjs.com. Also enable 2FA for publishing to further secure packages you maintain.",
