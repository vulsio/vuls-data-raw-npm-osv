The package fails to sanitize requests to the `require-node` endpoint, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code in the server through the injection of OS commands in the request body.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\n- If you are using 1.x, upgrade to version 1.3.4 or later.\n- If you are using 2.x, upgrade to version 2.0.4 or later.",
