	"summary": "Improper Authorization in passport-cognito",
	"details": "All versions of `passport-cognito` are vulnerable to Improper Authorization. The package fails to properly scope the variables containing authorization information, such as access token, refresh token and ID token. This causes a race condition where simultaneous authenticated users may receive authorization tokens for a different user. This would allow a user to take actions on another user's behalf.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
