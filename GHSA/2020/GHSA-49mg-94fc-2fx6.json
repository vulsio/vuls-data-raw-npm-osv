	"details": "All versions of `npm-git-publish` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package fails to sanitize input and passes it directly to an `execSync` call, which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system. The `publish` function is vulnerable through the `gitRemoteUrl` variable.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
