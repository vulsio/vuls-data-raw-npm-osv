	"details": "All versions of `expressfs` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package does not validate user input on several API endpoints, allowing attackers to run arbitrary commands in the system. The affected endpoints are: `expressfs.appendFile`,  `expressfs.cp`, `expressfs.create` and `expressfs.rmdir`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available.",
